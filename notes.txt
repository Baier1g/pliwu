IDEAS:
1. include <func> (, <func>)*  from <module>
2. compression of machinecode

DELIBERATIONS:
1: Strings and chars: Should chars be handled like strings or should 
                      they be handled differently? Should chars be able
                      to handle the extended ascii set, UTF-8 and other
                      character sets as well in the language?

TODOS:
1. find_keyword() (and find_type()) must be mapped or perfectly hashed
2. Restrict length of identifiers
3. Debug print for all modules during test
4. Proper error synchronization in parser
5. Find out how to properly import enums to grammar.y
6. Clean inputs on identifiers in rules.l
